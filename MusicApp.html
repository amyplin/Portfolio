      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>In my Information and Usability Architecture class, our final assignment was to structure a music application in high res wireframe form. The bulk of the project was deciding how we wanted to structure the app. Using some information we acquired through interviews, we were able to design a simplified music app. </p>
      <hr width="50%">
      <p>From our research, we realized that a lot of users said that it was too complicated to make and manage playlists. Often times they said they wish they maintained playlists because they make managing music so much easier, but admit that they were too lazy to bother with them. Since this was such a common problem, we decided to focus on how we could optimize the process of creating and maintaining playlists (deleting songs) for our app. </p>

      <h3>Hardest Decisions</h3>
      <p>The first difficult decision to make was how were we going to approach making a playlist. We could have multiple routes to a song similar to Spotify, but that seemed to be too overwhelming and our app would basically be Spotify. To elaborate, Spotify allows users to go to songs by genres, moods, artists, pre-made playlists etc. We decided based off of our research from part 1 that typically most users would just type into the search bar the song or artist they were looking for instead of browsing through artists. The only time they looked through browse was when they wanted to discover new songs. With this in mind, we decided to narrow the options to one route. (Which is in detail below). That way  each page is less cluttered and all the choices don’t overwhelm the user.</p>

    <h3>Hardest Decisions</h3>
      <p>Another hard decision we had to make was how we wanted the pagers to be related to each other. Did we want a home page? Or a menu bar on the side? Or did we want them to all intertwine with each other? We decided the cleanest way to display the options was with a home page. From the home page, the user has access to the search bar, playlists, songs, discover, radio, profile, and settings. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Another decision we had to make was deciding on which labels to use. With the research we did, we found that the multiple apps we looked at had various different labels (like for genres and moods). Many of the labels were only found on one app (less popular) and we weren’t sure what some of these label were. To eliminate any confusion, we decided to use labels that were common amongst all of the apps we looked at. </p>
